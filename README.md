# RungeKutta

Repository containing three applications of the Runge-Kutta numerical approximation.

FirstOrder
--
FirstOrder.c contains the source code pf a simple approximation of a first order PDE.

SecondOrder
--
SecondOrder.c contains the source code for a simple approximation of second order PDE.

RobotArm
--
RobotArm.c emulates the dynamic behaviour of a robot arm controlled by two input torque in order to reach a set configuration

One can adjust at will all the parameters of the system.
